	<p><b>Budget2024</b>: Amidst concerns over significant revisions to capital gains taxation, <i>Deepak Shenoy, CEO of Capitalmind</i>, has reassured investors that real estate continues to offer significant tax advantages, making it a highly favourable asset class.In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Shenoy highlighted the unique benefits of saving on long-term capital gains tax by reinvesting gains into a house and the ability to offset principal and interest payments on home loans against salary under Sections 80C and 24 of the Income Tax Act.Shenoy also noted that home loans typically have the lowest interest rates than business loans or loans against shares, further enhancing their appeal. Moreover, rental income from homes benefits from a 30 per cent standard deduction, with only the remaining amount taxed, unlike income from other assets, such as dividends from shares, which are fully taxed. While acknowledging a slight tax increase for some, Shenoy emphasized that real estate remains a “pampered asset class” due to these substantial tax advantages.</p>
	<p>Data shows that expenditure as a share of the total budget on infrastructure has increased. In contrast, expenditure on major schemes in the social sectors has either stagnated or declined.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Tuesday, presented the first Union Budget of the third term of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government. The Hindu Data team has compiled a series of graphs to analyse the impact of the Budget on select sectors and schemes.Data shows that expenditure as a share of the total budget on infrastructure has increased. In contrast, expenditure on major schemes in the social sectors, which includes education, pension and health, have either stagnated or declined. Spending on agriculture too, when considered as a share of the total budget, has stagnated. </p>
